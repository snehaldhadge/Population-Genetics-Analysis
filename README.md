# Population-Genetics-Analysis

Population genetic have been increasing and there is no standard file format for those programs, thus, 
being able to convert one file format to the other constitute an important asset. First part of the project 
focused on converting the Fasta file to Genepop file format, the entire data set comprised of a three states, 
homozygote, heterozygote and missing data.
Second Part consisted of exploratory statistical Analysis 
a) the average number of missing data per loci,
b) the proportion of homozygote and heterozygote in each population, 
c) and the inbreeding coefficient.
